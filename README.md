## Hey, I'm cco. 

Sysadmin, systems analyst, and developer. I am also the owner of Kulshan Labs, an IT consultancy business with a focus on small businesses and building paths for modernization. 

Outside of general administration and development, I also have a love for security. Much of my senior capstone centered around building command centers for malware distribution (in the "approved by the university" sense 👻).

I mostly program in C# / dotnet, Go, and various shell scripting languages like Bash and Powershell.

My current interests have been in homelabbing, LoRaWAN, and an endless desire to architect my apartments network like an enterprise datacenter (ask me about my kitchen server rack).
